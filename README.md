- **Less is more** - [Make tiny goals](#)
- **Crawl-walk-run** - [Try it slow](#). Start with small teams, then grow bigger. First, learn about goals. Then, make ‘em big!
- **Outcomes, not output** - [Count the fun](#), not the stuff we do. It’s about what happens, not how much we work.
- **OKRs are not everything** - [Pick the best bits](#). Focus on the important stuff! Don’t try to do it all at once.
- **The only way to learn OKRs is to do OKRs** - [Do and learn](#)
